Jelly Bean Code
========

The Jelly Bean Code was originally created as a Software Carpentry
Instructor final project. 

It currently contains one class that estimates the number of jelly 
beans in the world based on a few variables.

An example of how to use the code is in ExampleInput.py

TestInput.py provides a variety of test statements to ensure that 
assertion statements and warnings are working properly.

compute_Njelly_est_2(self) provides more in depth warning
statements than compute_Njelly_est(self).

Some users may wish to remove to edit the first lines of
EstNumJellyBeans.py, TestInput.py, and ExampleInput.py
depending on the path of their system.
